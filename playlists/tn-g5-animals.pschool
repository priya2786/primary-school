They are very closely associated with us in our daily life and contribute a lot to us.\n#Reproduction in animals\nReproduction is the biological process by which an organism givesrise to a new organism. In animals two types of reproduction are seen.They are: \n1. sexual reproduction \n2.  asexual reproduction.\n#1.Sexual Reproduction\nSexual reproduction is a natural way of reproduction in humans, animals and also in most of the plants. Sexual reproduction consists of the following stages.\na. Pre-fertilization - The male gamete reaches the female gamete during this stage.\nb. Fertilization - The fusion of gametes is known as fertilization which results in the formation of a fertilized egg, known as zygote. \nc. Post-fertilization - Embryo Formation\n# 2.Asexual Reproduction\nThe type of reproduction in which only a single parent, gets divided into two new offspring, is known as asexual reproduction. There are several ways by which animals reproduce asexually. Some of them are\na. Fission - An organism splits itself into two parts.Eg.,Sea anaemones, sea cucumbers.\nb. Budding - Budding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of the body. Then the bud is separated from the original organism forming two individuals. Eg., Hydras,corals.\nc. Fragmentation - Fragmentation is the breaking of an individual into parts followed by regeneration.eg., sponges, sea stars.\n#Causes for Endangerment\nThe following are the reasons why an animal or a plant is endangered or extinct.\n* Forests which provide food and shelter to animals are destroyed for human needs.\n* Large number of animals is hunted for their horns, skin, teeth and many other valuable products.\n*Pollutions like air pollution and water pollution affect the animals.\n* Sometimes animals are taken to new habitat by people. They cannot survive there.\n*Pesticides and chemicals which are used to get rid of insects, pests or weeds, poison the plants and animals.\n*Natural disasters like flood, cyclones and fire also destroy animals.\n#Saving endangered Species\n*Hunting and poaching animals should be prohibited.\n *We should not pollute the environment.\n*Limiting the usage of plastic and recycling it can save the endangered animals.\n*Pesticides and chemicals which pollute the environment should be avoided.\n* Planting native trees will provide food to the animals.\n* We should buy eco friendly products only. \n#Conservation of Animals\nConservation is the protection, preservation, management of wildlife and natural resources. Endangered species are maintained in certain protected areas such as national parks and wild life sanctuaries."},"id":"1597738491181"},{"type":"match","label":"Match the Following - Animals","slug":"match","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Match the words with same meaning.","text":"Zycote ,Fertilised Egg\nViviparous ,Cat\nEndangered animal ,Rhinoceros\nMudhumalai ,Elephant\nFragmentation ,Asexual Reproduction"},"id":"1597738528297"},{"label":"Choose the best answer - Animals","type":"mcq","slug":"mcq","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Multiple Choice Questions","questions":[{"qText":" Fission is a way of _____________ reproduction","options":"Asexual,Sexual,Viviparous,Oviparous"},{"qText":" ____________ is an oviparous animal.","options":"Duck,Cow,Deer,Goat"},{"qText":" Endangered animals are protected in ____________","options":"Sanctuary,Museums,Circus,Farm"},{"qText":" Mundanthurai sanctuary is located in ____________ district.","options":"Thirunelveli,Thiruppur,Tiruvarur,Thiruvallur"},{"qText":"The vision of Blue Cross is ___________ animals.","options":"Saving,Hunting,Capturing,Neglecting"}]},"id":"1597738534729"},{"label":"Fill in the blanks - Animals","type":"matchByDragDrop","slug":"drag-and-drop-blanks-template","editable":true,"data":{"isPractice":false,"title":"Drag and drop the words at proper places.","styles":{"fontSize":"1rem","dashWidth":70},"text":"Animals which give birth to young ones directly are named as *Viviparous animals*.\n*Hunting*of animals leads to endangered condition.\nGir National Park is famous for *Asiatic lions*.\nBlue Cross is an *Animal* welfare organization.\nNilgiri Tahr is an *wildlife* species"},"id":"1597738538067"}],"savePending":true,"id":"1597750139331","imported":true}
