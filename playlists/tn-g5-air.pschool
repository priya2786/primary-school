It is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). Other gases like carbon dioxide and argon comprise 1% of the atmosphere by volume. Atmosphere is divided into five different layers. \n1. Troposphere- The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere.  All weather changes also occur in this layer. \n2. Stratosphere - It extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. Ozone layer found in this layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet rays which can cause damage to our skin and eyes.\n3. Mesosphere - The region above the stratosphere is called the mesosphere.  Most of the meteors found in the sky burn in this layer.\n4. Thermosphere - The layer of very rare air above the mesosphere is called the thermosphere. \n5. Exosphere - The outermost layer of the atmosphere is called the exosphere. \n#Air Pollution\nThe presence of harmful substances in the air which can have an adverse effect on living beings and the environment is called air pollution. Air pollution is caused by both natural and manmade activities. Air pollutants are released into the atmosphere through human activities like burning of fuels, releasing industrial wastes, mining etc. Natural events like volcanic eruption also cause air pollution.Air pollution affects all living organisms including man. It causes serious health problems to human beings and affects both plants and animals. It brings about lot of changes in the climate and environment also. \n#Airborne Diseases\nDiseases which are caused by microorganisms and communicated through air are called airborne diseases. When we breathe in air there are chances for the microorganisms present in the air to get into our body. The microorganisms which cause airborne diseases are,\n1. Bacteria - Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tuberclosis are some of the common airborne diseases caused by bacteria.\n2. Virus - Common cold, influenza, measles, mumps and chickenpox are some of the diseases caused by virus. \n#Prevention\n* Avoid close contact with people who have active symptoms of disease.\n* Maintain personal hygiene.\n* Keep the patient in complete isolation.\n* Cover nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing.\n*  Avoid touching the face or other people with unwashed hands.\n*  Wash your hands thoroughly.\n* Timely vaccination can prevent the diseases.\n"},"id":"1597750595616"},{"label":"Choose the best answer - Air","type":"mcq","slug":"mcq","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Multiple Choice Questions","questions":[{"qText":" Chlorofluorocarbon is used in","options":"Refrigerator,Air conditioners,Both,None"},{"qText":"Which of the following gas is released by automobiles?","options":"Carbon monoxide,Oxygen,Hydrogen,Nitrogen"},{"qText":"A wind mill is used to produce","options":"Electric energy, Chemical energy,Mechanical energy,All of these"},{"qText":" Influenza is caused by","options":"Virus,Fungi,Bacteria,Protozoa"},{"qText":"Height of mesosphere which lies after troposphere is","options":"80 to 85km,70 to 75km,85 to 90km,75 to 80km"}]},"id":"1597750601112"},{"label":"Fill in the blanks - Air","type":"matchByDragDrop","slug":"drag-and-drop-blanks-template","editable":true,"data":{"isPractice":false,"title":"Drag and drop the words at proper places.","styles":{"fontSize":"1rem","dashWidth":70},"text":"Second highest layer of Earthâ€™s atmosphere is *Thermosphere*.\n Releasing substances like chemical compounds into the atmosphere is known as\n*Pollutants*.\n Airborne diseases can be caused by *Microorganisms*.\nThe *Ozone* layer protects us from the harmful UV rays coming from\nthe sun.\n*Nitrogen* is used by plants as nitrates."},"id":"1597750611613"},{"type":"match","label":"Match the Following - Air","slug":"match","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Match the words with same meaning.","text":"Troposphere,Weather change\nStratosphere,Ozone layer\nExosphere,Satellite\nThermosphere,Space craft\nMesosphere, Meteors"},"id":"1597750619210"}],"savePending":true,"id":"1597765044797","imported":true}
