The hydrosphere includes water that is present on the surface of the planet, underground, and in the air. Therefore, a planet’s hydrosphere can be in the form of liquid, vapour, or solid in the form of ice.\n#Types of water bodies\n1. Oceans: Oceans are vast water bodies that usually separate continents from one another. The water is salty in nature. There are five oceans on earth. They are: the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean. \n2. Sea: Seas are also vast water bodies but smaller than oceans in size. They are partly closed by land and opens up to the ocean. Sea water is salty in nature. Example: Arabian Sea\n3. Rivers: Rivers are large streams that flow over the land. Rivers are fresh water bodies which generally begin at mountainous areas. They usually drain in oceans or seas. Example: Ganga and cauvery.\n4. Lakes: A lake is a water body surrounded by land on all sides. Lakes can have salt or fresh water. Example: Dal Lake.\n5. Gulf: A gulf is a large area of an ocean or a sea that is surrounded by land. Example: Gulf of kuchch.\n6. Bay: A bay is a body of water, which is partially enclosed by land. It has a wide mouthed opening of land, and is joined to the sea or other large water bodies. Example: Bay of Bengal.\n7. Lagoon: A stretch of salt water separated from the sea by a low sand bank. Example: Lake Chilika in Odisha.\n8. Strait: A strait is a narrow stretch of water which joins two larger water bodies. Example: Palk Strait joining the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean.\n9. Waterfall: Water fall forms when a river flows from a great height. Example: Courtallam Waterfall\n#Stages of Water cycle\nStage I: Evaporation - The heat of the sun falls on the water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, rivers etc. The water slowly evaporates as vapours into the air.\nStage II: Condensation - As the vapours rise high, the cooler temperatures make them cool down and turn back into liquid. This is called condensation. Wind moves the liquid around, leading to the formation of clouds.\nStage III: Precipitation - Wind movements cause the clouds particles to collide. They become rain bearing clouds and fall back onto the earth’s surface by the process known as precipitation. This may occur in the form of rain, hail, snow or dew depending upon the temperature conditions.\nStage IV: Runoff and Infiltration - The water either runs off into oceans, rivers and ground surface or is absorbed into the soil (infiltration). This cycle continues."},"id":"1597769751022"},{"label":"Choose the best answer - Hydrosphere","type":"mcq","slug":"mcq","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Multiple Choice Questions","questions":[{"qText":"Hydrosphere is the total amount of __________ present on earth.","options":"Water,Air,Land,Plants"},{"qText":"Find the odd one.","options":"Ganga,Atlantic,Arctic,Pacific"},{"qText":"Water body that is surrounded by land on all side is called _______ ","options":"Lake,River,Gulf,Bay"},{"qText":"Evaporation is the _______ stage of the water cycle.","options":"First,Second,Third,Fourth"},{"qText":"Water body that is partially enclosed by land and has wide opening to the sea is called__________","options":"Bay,Sea,Strait,Pond"}]},"id":"1597769737178"},{"type":"match","label":"Match the following - Hydrosphere","slug":"match","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Match the words with same meaning.","text":"Fresh water,Dal lake\nA lagoon,Chilika in Odisha \nJoins Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal,Palk Strait\nInland salt water lake,Sambhar lake\nCondensation,Formation of cloud"},"id":"1597769757684"},{"label":"True or False - Hydrosphere","type":"classifySentence","slug":"classify","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Classify the below sentences as s","types":[{"name":"True","text":"About 97% of water on the earth is salt water. \nWe should save water."},True and False{"name":"False","text":"Water is not necessary for our basic needs.\nWater in the sea is sweet. \nWe should keep the tap open throughout while washing utensils."}]},"id":"1597769764524"}],"savePending":true,"id":"1597771777327","imported":true}
