Plants are not only used as food but also as medicine. They release oxygen, which is essential for our survival, into the atmosphere. \n# Reproduction in Plants \nReproduction is the process by which new individuals of the same species are produced. The flowers perform the function of reproduction in plants. There are two kinds of reproduction that take place in plants. They are sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, new plants are produced from roots, leaves, stems and buds. In sexual reproduction, new plants emerge from seeds. \n#Flower\nFlower is the reproductive part of a plant. It is a modified shoot. Flowers have four important parts.\n1. Sepal: It is the outer part of the flower. Usually it is small and green in colour. It protects the bud in the early stage.\n2. Petal:  It is often colourful and it attracts the insects.\n3.  Androecium It is the male reproductive part of the flower. It is composed of stamens. Each stamen consists of a stalk called filament and a small bag like structure called anther at the tip. The pollen grains are produced in the anther within the pollen sacs.\n4.  Gynoecium It is a female part of the flower. It has three parts. They are: ovary, style and stigma. The ovary contains the ovules. The flowers which contain either androecium or gynoecium are called unisexual flowers. E.g. Corn, Papaya, Cucumber. The flowers which contain both androecium and gynoecium are called bisexual flowers. E.g. Mustard, Rose.\nPollination\nThe transfer of pollen grains from the anther to stigma of a flower is called pollination. Pollination is the first important event in the development of fruit and seed. Pollination is followed by fertilization. Two types of pollination take place in the flowering plants. They are self pollination and cross pollination.\nThe transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower is called self pollination. The transfer of pollen grains of a flower to the stigma of another flower of a different plant of the same species is called cross pollination. \n#Fertilization\nThe process of fusion of male (pollen grains) and female (stigma) gametes is called fertilization. The cell which results after fusion of the gametes is calleda zygote. The zygote develops into an embryo.\n#Fruits and Seed Formation\nAfter fertilization, the ovary grows into a fruit and other parts of the flower fall off. The seeds develop from the ovules. The seed contains an embryo enclosed in a protective seed coat.\n#Life Cycle of a Flowering Plant\nThe major stages of the flowering plants are the germination of seed, growth, flowering, re-production (pollination), seed formation and seed spreading. Every seed has minute plant called the embryo.\n1. Dispersal of Seeds: Spreading of seeds from one place to another with the help of agents like air, water, animals and birds is known as dispersal of seeds. A single plant produces a large number of seeds. \n2. Germination of Seeds: The seed is a fertilized ovule. It consists of embryo, food materials which are protected by the seed coat. During favourable conditions, the seed germinates and gives rise to a new seedling.
