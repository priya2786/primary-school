        "text": "Water is one of the most important resources on Earth. All living things like small organisms, plants and animals need water to survive. People use water for various purposes. Rain is one of the main sources of water.\n# Potable Water\nDrinking water is known as potable water. Potable water is water that is good to drink and useful for food preparation.\nPotable Water should be:\n1. free from dangerous chemicals.\n2. transparent.\n3. odourless and colourless.\n4. free from bacteria which cause diseases.\n# Sources of Drinking Water\nWater is available in many natural sources, but not all the water sources are suitable for drinking. Water should be boiled to kill the germs in it, and only then it is suitable for drinking. A few sources of water are rain, well, river, lake and stream.\n# Saving Water\nOnly 3% of the water in the entire Earth is freshwater. Water is precious. So, we should never waste water.\nSome methods to prevent wastage of water:\n1. Never allow water to overflow from buckets.\n2. Wash fruits and vegetables in a bowl of water and not under running tap water.\n3. Always close the taps while brushing the teeth.\n4. Use left over water in your water bottle to water a potted plant.\n5. Turn off the tap after each use.\n6. Use a sprinkler to water the garden.\n# Conservation of Water Bodies\nAll the water that we get comes from rain. When it rains, some water flows over the ground giving rise to streams and rivers. Some water gets collected in low lying areas such as ponds and lakes. The flow of the river is blocked by building a dam across it. Some rainwater seeps into the ground as underground water.\n# Lake\nIt is a large area filled with water surrounded by land. It is usually a part of a river or some other water source.\n# Pond\nA pond is a body of stagnant water, either natural or artificial; it is smaller than a lake.\n# Tanks\nA water tank is a container for storing water for our daily use.\n# Methods to Conserve Water Bodies\n1. Deepening of ponds and lakes\n2. Plant trees at the bank of the lake and pond\n3. Reduce water pollution\n4. Avoid digging too many wells in a region\n# Water borne diseases\nStagnant water can become a breeding ground for the mosquitoes that transmit diseases. Malaria and Dengue Fever are the main dangers of stagnant water.\nWaterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid are caused by drinking unclean water.\n# Experiment\nLet us assemble a Simple Pump\n{\"type\": \"img\", \"src\": \"science/waterPumpExperiment.png\"}\n# Materials needed\nAny hollow tube â€“ PVC, metal or even a long papaya stem\n# Procedure\nHold the tube with your left hand and move it up and down into a bucket of water. Keep the palm of your right hand on the top of the tube and open and close it with each up and down reciprocation. Soon, water will start squirting out. Here the up-down motion of the left hand does the pumping while the right palm acts like a valve.\n# Do you know?\n1. A camel can drink 60 to 100 litres of water at a time and live without water for several days.\n2. World Water Day is observed on 22nd March."
