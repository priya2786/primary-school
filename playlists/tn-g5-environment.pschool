There are two types of Environment. They are physical environment and biological environment. Physical environment includes all non-living things like land, water and air. Biological environment includes the living things such as plants and animals. \n#Farms\nFarming is the activity of growing crops and raising livestock. It is a part of agriculture. Agriculture is the cultivation of land and breeding of animals and plants to provide food, fiber, woods and medicinal plants to sustain and enhance life. But, farming is more profitable than agriculture. So it is done on a commercial scale.\n1. Dairy farm\n2. Poultry farming\n#Dairy Farm\nDairy farming is a type of agriculture that focuses on extraction of milk and preparation of various milk products like cheese, butter, curd etc. \n*Cattle breeds: In India there are 26 cattle breeds. They are domesticated for milk, agricultural work, transportation and many other needs.\n#Poultry Farms\nIn poultry farms avian species are reared and bred for the purpose of egg, meat or both. Fowls, ducks, geese, turkeys and some verities of pigeon are the most commonly reared species. \n#Apiculture\nRearing of honey bee for honey is known as apiculture. It is also called bee keeping. In this technique honey bees are reared in a specially designed wooden box. Honey bees have been very closely associated with humans since ancient times. Various products like honey and wax are obtained from honey bees.  \n#Manure\nManure is an organic matter used as fertiliser. It is mostly derived from animal and plant residues. It increases the fertility of the soil by adding nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. It is a natural form of fertiliser and it is cheaper. Types of Manure are\n1. Animal Manure - It contains the feces and urine of different livestock like horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkey and rabbits\n2. Green Manure - This is a manure obtained by decomposition of green leaves, twigs of trees, shrubs and herbs. Leguminous plants like clover are used for this purpose. These plants are ploughed in the soil. They fix nitrogen in the root of the plants. \n3. Compost - Compost is obtained by decomposition of organic matter like crop residues, animal wastes and food wastes by various microorganisms like bacteria and fungi under controlled conditions. These microorganisms break down organic matter into simpler substances.\n# Vermiculture\nVermiculture or Vermicomposting is a method of transforming organic wastes such as waste papers, leaves, pieces of woods etc., into a nutrient rich fertilizer using earth worms. It is a healthy and clean way to eliminate wastes going into our landfills. It keeps the environment clean. Earthworms eat the organic wastes and excrete it in the form of castings. This is known as vermicompost. It is used as fertilizer for the soil and it improves the properties of the soil.
