It fills the seas, rivers and lakes, and covers more than two-thirds of the earth’s surface. It also exists as snow and ice on mountains. In the atmosphere, water is present in huge quantities as vapour and clouds.  \n#1. River Water and Lake Water\nRiver is a channel through which fresh water flows. The origin of river is usually hills or mountains. It flows towards ocean, sea and lakes. Lake is an area filled with water. Man-made lakes created when dam is built on a river is called reservoir. Small areas filled with water are called ponds. Rivers, streams, groundwater, rainfall, melting snows or a combination of these are the sources of water in lakes, reservoirs and ponds.\n#2. Sea Water\nDue to the presence of more amount of salt, sea water is called saline water. It is not suitable for irrigation as well as drinking. \n#3. Underground water\nDuring rainfall, part of the rain water gets absorbed in the soil. It flows through various layers of the soil till it reaches hard rock, where it gets accumulated to form reservoir. This reservoir of water is the underground water.\n#4. Well Water\nWhen the earth’s surface is dug deep, water reservoirs are found above the rocks. The depth of a well varies from place to place.\n#5. Spring Water\nSometimes the accumulated underground water applies pressure on the rocks and comes out of the earth’s surface in the form of a spring from any available opening. This water is called spring water. \n#Water Cycle\nContinuous movement of water from the Earth to the atmosphere and back to the Earth is known as water cycle or hydrologic cycle. Water cycle consists of the following four stages.\n1. Evaporation: The process in which water is changed into water vapour by the heat of the sun is called evaporation. \n2. Condensation: The process of converting water vapour into water on cooling is called condensation.\n3. Precipitation: The water droplets join together to form clouds. As they get cooler, the droplets become bigger and heavier and fall as rain.\n4. Flowing back to Oceans: Rain water forms streams and springs which join together to form rivers. Rivers flow finally into the sea and ocean thereby completing the cycle.\n#WaterManagement\n#Fresh water management\nWater management is the activity of planning, developing and managing the optimum use of water resources. Water which is obtained naturally from ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, ice bergs, ponds, lakes, rivers, streams and underground are called fresh water.\n1. Rain Water Harvesting: The process of collecting rain water from the roof top of the buildings is called rain water harvesting. In this system rain water is stored into a storage tank for later use. \n2. Farm Ponds: A farm pond is a structure dug out on the Earth. It is usually square or rectangular in shape. Rainwater is stored in it for irrigation purposes.  Water is conveyed to the fields manually, by pumping, or by both.\n#Waste Water Management\nUsed water from any combination of activities such as domestic (houses), industrial, commercial, agricultural is called waste water. This water has been used for laundry, bathing, dish washing, toilets and industrial purposes.\n*Waste water Treatment: Generally, waste water is treated by physical, chemical and biological processes using filtration, sedimentation, adding cow dung, powder and bacteria. This method is followed in industries.\n#Desalination of Sea Water\nDesalination is an artificial process of converting saline water (sea water) into fresh water. The common desalination processes are: Distillation and Reverse Osmosis\nThe process in which both evaporation and condensation go side by side is called distillation. Reverse osmosis is a process of forcing water under pressure through a semi permeable membrane. Tiny pores in the membrane allow water to pass but exclude most salts and minerals. The reverse osmosis process helps to solve the water scarcity problem."}},{"id":1597678387324,"label":"Choose the best answer - Water","type":"mcq","slug":"mcq","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Multiple Choice Questions","questions":[{"qText":"Which of the following micro organisms causes waterborne diseases?","options":"All,Bacteria,Virus,protozoa"},{"qText":"Water is present in huge quantities as vapour and clouds in the ________","options":"Atmosphere,Sky,Earth,Rain"},{"qText":"________ water is free from suspended impurities.","options":"Underground,Sea,Well,River"},{"qText":"________ of water is in oceans and seas","options":"97%,87%,47%,77%"},{"qText":"__________ is an artificial process of converting sea water into fresh water","options":"Desalination,Decantation,Distillation, Reverse Osmosis"}]}},{"id":1597678403200,"label":"Fill in the blanks - Water","type":"matchByDragDrop","slug":"drag-and-drop-blanks-template","editable":true,"data":{"isPractice":false,"title":"Drag and drop the words at proper places.","styles":{"fontSize":"1rem","dashWidth":70},"text":"The accumulated underground water comes out in the form of *Reservoir*.\nThe process of changing water into water vapour by the heat of the Sun is called\n*Evaporation*.\nRain water forms streams and *springs* which join together to form rivers.\nThe process of collecting and storing rain water is called *Rainwater Harvesting*.\nCholera is caused by *Bacteria*."}},{"id":1597678425013,"type":"match","label":"Match the Following","slug":"match","editable":true,"data":{"title":"Match the words with same meaning.","text":"Leakage of oil,Pollute marine organisms\nReservoir,Man-made lake\nDistillation,cloud\nRainwater harvesting,plant growth\nSwine Flu,Influenza virus"}}],"savePending":true,"id":"1597835681154","imported":true}
