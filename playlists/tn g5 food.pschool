We get these nutrients from the food we eat. If we do not take all these nutrients in the right proportion, it results in some diseases. Sometimes, we do not preserve the food properly and it gets spoiled. Sometimes through spoiled food also we get diseases. So we need to preserve the food we eat.\n#Spoilage of Food\nThe change in the normal state of the food is called spoilage of food. Spoiled food becomes unsuitable to eat.\nFood can be spoiled by factors like Air and Oxygen, Moisture, Enzymes, Micro-Organisms, Temperature, and light.\nMicroorganisms present in spoiled food may cause food-borne diseases like vomiting, Dystentry, Stomach pain, Fever, and Indigestion.\n#Preservation of Food\nThe Food Preservation Methods are \n1. Drying\n2. Addition of Salt\n3. Addition of Sugar\n4. Freezing\n5. Canning\n6. Boiling and Bottling\n7. Addition of Chemical Preservatives\n#Obesity\nObesity and overweight are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation in the body that may affect the health. Obesity is most commonly caused by excessive food intake, lack of physical activity and also genetic reasons \n#Disease\nA disease is an abnormal condition that affects a living organism. This abnormal condition affects the structure and function of the organism. Diseases may be caused by external factors as well as internal dysfunction.\n#1. Causes of Diseases\nDiseases are caused by microorganisms like bacteria, virus, protozoa and fungi. They are transmitted by insects, and also through contaminated air and water. Some diseases are caused when the function of the organ is affected. In general, causes of diseases can be classified as below.\n* Metabolic factor. E.g. Diabetes\n* Genetic factor. E.g. Colour blindness\n* Microorganisms. E.g. Bacterial diseases\n*Nutritional factor. E.g. Marasmus\n*Environmental factor. E.g. Cholera\n#2. Types of Diseases\nThere are four main types of diseases. They are:\na. Infectious diseases - Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms which invade our body and multiply inside them. These diseases are spread from one person to another. E.g. Common cold.\nb. Hereditary diseases - Hereditary diseases occur due to abnormalities in the gene. These diseases are passed from parents to children. E.g. Heart disease.\nc. Physiological diseases - Diseases which are caused due to malfunction of the body organs are called physiological diseases. E.g. Asthma.\nd. Deficiency diseases - A diet which contains all essential nutrients in correct proportion is indispensable for maintaining good health. Deficiency in one or more of the nutrients causes various diseases. These are called deficiency diseases.\n * Protein deficiency diseases:  Marasmus and Kwashiorkor are the protein deficiency diseases. In marasmus, the child loses weight and it will appear as though bones are covered by skin. In Kwashiorkor, the child develops an enlarged belly with swollen face and feet. By eating protein rich foods like egg, milk, fish and green leafy vegetables we can avoid protein deficiency diseases.\n* Vitamin and mineral deficiency diseases: Certain diseases are caused by deficiency of vitamins and minerals. By eating vitamin and mineral rich food items, we can avoid these diseases.
